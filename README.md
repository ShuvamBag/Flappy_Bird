# Flappy_Bird 

The objective is to keep the bird airborne for as long as possible by tapping or clicking the screen, causing the bird to flap its wings and ascend. The challenge lies in the precise timing required to maneuver the bird through the gaps between the pipes, as a single collision with either the ground or a pipe results in an instant game over.

The game's mechanics are straightforward, but its execution demands exceptional hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes. With each successful gap cleared, players earn points, and the ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score possible. Flappy Bird intentionally lacks any progress checkpoints or levels, emphasizing a relentless difficulty curve that ramps up the longer the player survives.

Made using Flutter and Dart.
